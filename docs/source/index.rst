Welcome to LDAQ documentation!
===============================================================

This package provides an extendable interface for data acquisition and generation. It is designed to be quickly set-up, easy to use and accomodate a wide range of data sources.

The source-code for this package is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/ladisk/LDAQ>`_.

The package enables data **acquisition** from multiple sources, signal **generation** on multiple ouputs, and costumizable **live data visualization**.

Examples of the acquisition/generation code for commonly used sources are presented in the examples notebooks.

.. note::
   
   To quickly add acquisition code to your project, go to the :doc:`snippets` page, where you can copy and paste the code you need.

For the more in-depth documentation, start with the :doc:`simple_start` page.
